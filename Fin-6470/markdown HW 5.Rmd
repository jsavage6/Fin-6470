5.2

a.

$$
50 - ((1*e^{-.015*1})+(1*e^{-.015*2})+(1*e^{-.015*3})+(1*e^{-.015*4})) = $46.15
$$

b.

$$
46.15*e^{.06*1} = $49.00
$$

5.3

a.

$$
$50*e^{(.08)(1)} = $46.16
$$

b.

$$
50*e^{(.06-.08)1} = $49.01
$$

5.4

a.

$$
$50*e^{(.08)(.5)} = $35.89
$$

b.
$$
\frac{1}{.5} * ln \frac{35.50}{35} = .028
$$

c.

$$
35.5 = 35e^{(.05- \delta)(.5)}
    -->   ln 1.01428 = ln(.05- \delta)(.5)
    -->   \delta = .0216
$$

5.6

a.

$$
$1100e^{(.05-.015)(.75)} = $1129.26
$$
  
  b. Sell the short postion and lend the money out
  
  c. borrow money to buy short position
  
5.7

  a. The forward is too expensive so you short it by making a synthetic forward at $1127.85 and make a profit of $7.15 with pure arbitrage strategy
  
  b. The forward is too cheap so you do the opposite as part 1 and make $12.85

5.8

  a. The price of $1120 is too expensive so we short it and and make $3.38 as the price is $1116.82
  
  b. The price of $1110 is too cheap so we buy it and make a $6.82 profit as the price is $1116.82
  
5.9

  a. You would go back in time with a huge amount of cash, invest it in 1981 then travel forward to 1982 and collect it.  Rinse, wash and repeat.
  
  b. Market rates would be driven down, the manager would be dumb to keep going back to the same date instead of varying it so the market would have a lot harder time adjusting.
  
5.11

  a. (4)(250)(1200) = $1,200,000
  
  b. 1,200,000 * .10 = $120,000
  
5.15

a.

$$
F^{+} = 800e^{.055} = $845.23
$$
$$
F^{-} = 800e^{.05} = $841.02
$$

b.

$$
F^{+} = (800 + 1)e^{.055} = $846.29
$$
$$
F^{-} = (800 - 1)e^{.05} = $839.97
$$

c.

$$
F^{+} = (800 + 340)e^{.055} = $848.82
$$
$$
F^{-} = (800 - 340)e^{.05} = $837.44
$$

d.

$$
F^{+} = (800 + 340)e^{.055} +2.40 = $848.82
$$
$$
F^{-} = (800 - 340)e^{.05} -2.40 = $837.44
$$

e.

$$
F^{+} = (800 * 1.003 +800 * .003 + 1)e^{.055} = $851.36
$$
$$
F^{-} = (800 * .997 +800 * .003 + 1)e^{.05} = $834.92
$$

5.16

a.

$$
F_{0,1} = 875e^{.0475} = $917.57
$$

b. One futures contract is equal to 250*875 = $218,750 so need to take $800,000/$218,750 which equals 3.657. Next we need to adjust for beta, which is 1.1 so 3.657 * 1.1 = 4.023 meaning we should short 4.023 contracts.
