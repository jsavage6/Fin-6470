##Crash of 1987

The paer starts by looking at what might have caused the stock market crash in 1987.  States that the main scapegoats might not be the actual problem.  They are going to examine whether or not the crash happened because it was expected to happen, in other words, was it a self fulfilling prophecy.  The period was a 42% year to date gain in 1987 followed by a 2 day 23% loss in the market.  Looked at what people thought before the crash happened.  Most people said afterwords in surveys that they knew the market was overvalued.  Next they talk about how hindsight is 20/20 and that those surveys were very likely biased.  Instead of following surveys the authors choose to use option prices to see if the market imploded because the market expected.

It turns out that there is evidence that the market predicted a crash but they were kind of wrong, let me explain.  In order to show that options expected the market to crash they looked at deep out of the money put options and looked at the prices.  The price for those puts became very overvalued because of speculation, therefore showing the market did expect a big dive.  There was a problem to this though.  Everyone was puting their money on August, not October when it actually crashed.  After nothing happened in august everybody assumed they were wrong and went all back to normal.  In october 1987 the market crashed hard.  Those that predicted that the markets were going to crash were right about it being overvalued...but wrong on the timing.
