He found that it was cointegrated and that the market didn't appreciate it sufficiently enough so that you could make higher than market returns.  To find this he used stationarity tests, multivariate cointegration tests and error-correction models.  After seeing all the tests and the models I was persuaded by the evidence and results in the data.
  
This statement applies to Liu's paper because in order for Liu to investigate this he would need to look at futures markets in a state of disequilibrium.  If he were not to be a little Austrian he would not even think that there would be an arbitrage opportunity.  Once looking at the findings he has to think that this is an arbitrage opportunity rather than thinking maybe shipping costs or other external costs make it priced different.  I definitely think it is true.  The market is a sum of all the minds in the market together and sometimes those collective minds get things wrong or rather it takes time and arbitrageurs to help the price come closer to equilibrium.  To understand this one needs to be a little bit Austrian.  The best way to describe Liu's econometric model in a neo-austrian sense is to look at the econometrics model as a map but not as something strict.  The "map" helps find about where prices should be if they were in equilibrium so that way he can compare them to the actual prices.  The map lets him know how he can make money.  The map is the neo side but the Austrian in him helps him realize that the econometric model is just that, a map.
  
He uses certain standard devation points to determine buying (selling) signals in the market.  When this happens he will execute one trade on the lean hog futures and make the opposite trade in the corn and soybean futures.  So if he went long in hog he will go short in corn and soybean and viceversa.  When the prices revert back to equilibrium he would close out his positions.  I would be hesitant about trading this with real money because they have high pvalues real time.  Also, I don't know enough about the those markets so much so it would make me uncomfortable.  In order to be convinced I would need to look more into that market in particular and see more about why the p-values are high.
