Enron didnt fail because its traders went rogue or anything of the sort, Enron failed because it got away from its comparative advantage.  It overvalued different ideas that could add value to the company and by doing so slowing failed.  This is important because many people have said that more regulation and oversight is needed to prevent this from happening again.  Any such claims should be met with suspision.  

Neoclassical economics and neoaustrian economics
  
  a. it is the difference between comparative statics and the market being in constant flux that precludes stationary states because expectations and knowledge everything in the market and affecting the market always changing.  
  
  b. Culp and Hanke argue for using neo-austrian framework by using forward prices, that constantly changes and is in flux also.  They mention that even though the price is constantly changing that the processes aim is to generate consistent prices.
  
Enron was basically a wholesale merchant/intermediate supply chain.  They sold themselves as a network manager.  They invested in broad areas but their main focus was in energy, in many different forms.  Deregulation opened up many different and profitable strategies but their is a misconcenption that this is the Enron failed and what led to the huge fiasco but this is wrong.  Rapidly falling gas prices led them to explore natural gas derivatives to hedge risk and formed Gas Bank.  They promised liquidity and became the market maker.  They made lots of money doing it but exposed themselves to lots of risk without covering it.  The way they tried was by buying offestting positions in the same market.  This isn't a bad idea or immoral.  It is an entrepreneurial thing that was executed poorly.

Enron started toiling with asset heavy ventures, which wasnt their comparative advantage and also had a hard time executing their successful asset lite strategies into markets other than energy markets.  They ended up failing because of this.  They tried to overexxagerate the size of the market they created and this actually benefitted their competitors.  they started to create offshore subsidiaries and concealed their debt and this is what led to the events that everyone knows.
