##Arbitrage choice theory

This papercompares the tradiotional rational choice theory with arbitrage choice theory

  a. rational choice theory is how individuals make individual choices
  
  b. arbitrage choice theory is how people will make choices together when there are groups of people
  
    1. similarities between the two theories include how poeple wil always want to maximize utility, maintain competitive equilibrium and they expect their beliefs to be updated with their beliefs
    
    2. differences include the fact that utility and probability functions do not need to be unique, they can be the same, the whole allais paradox is not a thing in the arbitrage choice theory and utility functions do not need to be state dependent
