**Midterm**

1.

	a. shorting futures

	b. going long futures

	c. The formula for the discrete discount is $$F_{0,t} = S_{0}e^{rt} - \sum ^{n}_{i=1} e^{r(T-t_{i})}$$  the changes the equation by adding the sum of the dividends and finding the present value of them.  the equation for the continuous dividend is$$F_{0,t} = S_{0}e^{(r-\delta)t}$$  the change here to the formula is to subtract the dividend yield from the rate
  
      d. the pricing equation becomes the following if there exists storage costs$$F_{0} \geq S_{0}e^{(r+ \lambda - c)T}$$  The lambda represents storage costs, making the forward price more expensive and the c is the convenience yield which will make the forward price cheaper.  The formula becomes greater than or equal to because if the forward price becomes too low they won't exercise the contract, they will just consume the commodity

    e. This is true because of arbitrage.  If there was a difference between forward and spot prices at the same time T then people would buy low and sell high until that difference was gone.  This has to be the case.

    f. The benefit would to be for CEO's and high end individuals who want to get cash up front for shares but don't want to be seen as inside traders.  They could contract with an investment bank and say they want like 75% of the cash upfront and then give them the shares later when they retire.  This would prevent investors freaking out over the trading

4. The institutional difference between futures and forwards markets is that forward markets are over the counter and futures are more standardized and traded on an exchange.  Historically futures contracts have always existed because of the need to of farmers to lock in their profits and people needing to lock in the price of their product.  Futures markets as we know them came about in about the seventies when a bunch of farmers got together in Chicago to trade their contracts and it started ti catch on. No one person orchestrated it, it just occurred as people tried to arbitrage the situation and tried to secure their profits.  Once it started happening people quickly realized they needed a clearinghouse to make their contracts safer from counter-party risk and to coordinate transactions.  People started to trade around delivery schedules and also around seasons.  These markets have solved many problems and created many businesses.  It has allowed people to hedge their losses and also to lock in profit.  It has created infinitely new ways to arbitrage the market.

  a. He found that it was cointegrated and that the market didn't appreciate it sufficiently enough so that you could make higher than market returns.  To find this he used stationarity tests, multivariate cointegration tests and error-correction models.  After seeing all the tests and the models I was persuaded by the evidence and results in the data.
  
  b. This statement applies to Liu's paper because in order for Liu to investigate this he would need to look at futures markets in a state of disequilibrium.  If he were not to be a little Austrian he would not even think that there would be an arbitrage opportunity.  Once looking at the findings he has to think that this is an arbitrage opportunity rather than thinking maybe shipping costs or other external costs make it priced different.  I definitely think it is true.  The market is a sum of all the minds in the market together and sometimes those collective minds get things wrong or rather it takes time and arbitrageurs to help the price come closer to equilibrium.  To understand this one needs to be a little bit Austrian.  The best way to describe Liu's econometric model in a neo-austrian sense is to look at the econometrics model as a map but not as something strict.  The "map" helps find about where prices should be if they were in equilibrium so that way he can compare them to the actual prices.  The map lets him know how he can make money.  The map is the neo side but the Austrian in him helps him realize that the econometric model is just that, a map.
  
  c. He uses certain standard devation points to determine buying (selling) signals in the market.  When this happens he will execute one trade on the lean hog futures and make the opposite trade in the corn and soybean futures.  So if he went long in hog he will go short in corn and soybean and viceversa.  When the prices revert back to equilibrium he would close out his positions.  I would be hesitant about trading this with real money because they have high pvalues real time.  Also, I don't know enough about the those markets so much so it would make me uncomfortable.  In order to be convinced I would need to look more into that market in particular and see more about why the p-values are high.

	a. MG would contract with someone to deliver oil at time T and then go out and buy a future contract that expired at the end of the month and rolled it over.  This pretty much made the company's net worth hedged.  This is different than minimum variance hedging because minimum variance hedging looks to lock in cash flows and minimize risk where this strategy was locking in the basis and looking to "synthetically store" their future obligations.  If they wanted to do minimum variance hedging they wouldn't have done a 1 to 1 hedge ratio.

	b. MG's optimal hedging strategy was a 1 to 1 hedging strategy as Culp and Miller stated.  Pyrrong was in the wrong because he missed what the whole strategy was.  Pyrrong thought they were after a minimum variance hedging and if he were right the optimal hedge ratio would have been .5.  The reason why 1 to 1 was optimal was because they were involved with synthetic storage and wanted to lock in the basis.

	c. He invoked Bayes rule because he is saying, from his point of view, that they wouldn't continue to make the same hedges as they continued to lose money.  This all depended on how Pyrrong saw MG strategy.  He saw it as a company that as they continue to lose money (on paper) they continue to double down and was all speculative.  He is saying that if they were Bayesian they would have updated their strategy and stopped and started doing an optimal hedge.

	d. Yes and no.  Yes because it will cause short term liquidity issues.  If they can deal with this then it isn't a problem and it is all good.  No because they already know that it will go into short term contango but because of their strategy they will make more during backwordation than they will lose during contango and will be NPV positive. 

7. the evidence in the both articles support Hayek's main thesis.  The first article, is talking about the volume levels in trading pits and volatility.  It talked about how the higher the volume in the pits the higher the volatility in the market.  This is very much in line with what Hayek says in that the market is a conglomerate of all the minds in the market put together.  No one organizes this yet through the collective actions and reactions of everybody in the market the market gropes its way towards equilibrium prices and also sends us signals.  The collective anxiety filled shouting of all the traders in the pit indicate what it going on.  When things are going to plan the volume isn't too loud but when uncertainty hits, like it always does, everyone loses their collective minds and it is heard.  The second article is about how they tried to predict orange prices by the weather and long story short it turns out that even though they couldn't predict orange prices using weather they could predict weather using orange prices.  The collective mind of all the farmers looking at their crops and then trading based on that is as Hayekian as it gets. 

8. The futures markets, bayesian forecasting and risk modeling talks about how the process of market making, and derivatives as well, is a bayesian system and that the fair price can only be reached when many are participating.  He compares it to children slicing a pie, one child slices the pie and the other chooses the slice.  The same with market making, the market maker names the bid ask and others choose to buy in.  If it is not a fair price, or is not what equilibrium price should be, then people will take advantage and arbitrage the company, at which point they will have to adjust.  The more participants the better, this goes along very nicely with Hayek's main theory.  The people with common everyday knowledge will know better and that many know more than the few.

9. I think that futures markets will creep into our everyday lives over the next twenty years.  This will no longer be something only sophisticated financial experts will deal with but also consumers.  We will deal with futures contracts for basics like maybe bread or water (more likely water).  I think that one product that will be traded on the futures exchange will be marijuana.  I think it will be legalized and will be exploited through these markets.  This will help make global trade to become more efficient and bring prices down all over the world and help to make the law of one price a global reality.  It will spark more innovation and more business as more and more people have more access to products at cheaper prices.  A business strategy that I could employ in the future is that of weed storer and distributor(once legalized of course).  To employ this strategy I would make a synthetic storage of weed.  I would make a contract to deliver (future obligation) weed and for every ounce I was obligated to deliver I would buy 1 future contract to hedge it.  I would only do 1 month out contracts and I would roll it over and I would lock in the basis on weed.  I would need to find out if the market was in backwordation or contango in the long term and adjust my strategy as needed and also would need to have quants to execute optimal trades.
